## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ochuks1/alx-specialization_project.git
   cd alx-specialization_project

2. Set up the backend:
   cd backend
   npm install

3. Set up the frontend:
   cd ../frontend/subsea-dashboard
   npm install

4. Run the project:
   Backend: node server.js
   Frontend: npm start
